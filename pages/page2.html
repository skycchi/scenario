                        As Gabriel heads outside, he spots his friend Leonardo - who he affectionately calls Len - standing in front of his house. He doesn't seem to hear Gabriel as he taps away on his phone.

                        Len and him have been friends since they were 10. They knew each other's secrets, all except for one. One secret that Gabriel has been keeping in him for over 4 years.

                        Of course, he would never say this out loud. He's afraid to ruin their relationship. Besides, they go to catholic school. Their peers would never let them live it down.

                        In short: homophobia. Oh, what a marvelous world.<br>
                        Ultimately, he decides to preserve their friendship and not risk the potential consequences.

                        As he gets closer to his friend, Len perks his head up. A big smile spreads across his face as he takes in the sight of Gabriel. He puts his phone away quickly.

                        Len's hazel eyes sparkle, like they always seem to when he looks at Gabriel. Gabriel returns Len's smile, feeling his heart skip a beat.

                        As they start walking towards the school, Gabriel can't help stealing glances at Len. He takes in every detail - the way Len's hair falls effortlessly, the warmth in his smile, and the way he walks with an air of confidence.

                        Gabriel's feelings for Len have only grown stronger over the years, and it both comforts and torments him.

                        As they approach the school gates, Gabriel takes a deep breath, pushing aside his fears for now. He's determined to make the most of their remaining time together in high school, cherishing their friendship as it is, even if it means keeping his love hidden away.
