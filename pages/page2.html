                        As Gabriel heads outside, he spots his friend Leonardo (who he affectionately calls Len) standing in front of his house. He doesn't seem to hear Gabriel as he taps away on his phone.

                        Len and him have been friends since they were 10. They knew each other's secrets, all except for one. One secret that Gabriel has been keeping in him for over 4 years.

                        He is in love with Len.

                        Of course, he would never say this out loud. He was afraid to ruin their relationship. Besides, they went to catholic school. Their peers would never let them live it down.

                        In short: homophobia. Oh, what a marvelous world.

                        As he got closer to his friend, Len perked his head up. A big smile spread across his face as he took in the sight of Gabriel. He put his phone away quickly.
