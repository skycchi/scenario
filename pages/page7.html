                        Len runs up to Gabriel, who had been knocked off his feet due to the preceding fight. He was covered in the Creation's blood that had rained down as he was attacking it. He reaches his hand out for Gabriel. Gabriel gratefully accepts the hand and shakily gets up.

                        "What the actual fuck was that? What the hell is going on??? And... how did I even know what to do?"
                        <div class="footer"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></div>
                    </div>

                        Gabriel is at a loss for words. He instead opts to look around at the carnage that was left of the Creation. Bodies are littered around it - those who were unfortunate enough to be close to the Creation when it suddenly appeared. This couldn't be real...
                        <div class="footer"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="inner">
                        <div class="header">5/7</div>
                        His mind begins racing. What are they going to do? They can't linger for too long unless they want to get ambushed by another Creation. And how is Len so calm and collected about this?
                        <div class="footer"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></div>
                    </div>

                        <div class="header">6/7 Len</div>
                        "Gabriel! Listen to me! We've got to get out of here before more of those things show up! Come on!"
                        <div class="footer"><i class="fa-solid fa-caret-down"></i></div>
                    </div>

                    <div class="inner">
                        <div class="header">7/7 Len</div>
                        Gabriel snaps out of his trance as Len grabs his arm and leads them into the school building. He can hear screams in the distance. Oh god, there are more. Oh god. Oh god. Oh god.
